# Welcome to Web Automation

### Where your data entry is made **A piece of cake**.



## What is Web Automation?

Web Automation is a desktop application used to automate
**Data extraction** & **Entry** with the help of **Excel** files,
**Web tools** and a simple yet **sophisticated UI** .



## What it utilizes. 

The project is built using the **[Nextjs](https://nextjs.org/)** framework of **[React](https://react.dev/)**. Unlike most
Nextjs based projects, this one runs on **Desktop** instead of being a 
web application.


### How?

The project combines **Nextjs** with **[Electron.js](https://www.electronjs.org/)** to create a cross-platform desktop
application with **Web-technologies**.


## Where do yoy find out more?

The **[document](/docs/Documentation/Key%20Features/features.md)** serves as a blueprint for the development of the application, ensuring alignment between stakeholders and developers.

The **[Workflow](/docs/User%20Workflow/Login/Sign-In-Form.md)** depicts a real user workflow for the targeted users.

# Let's get started!! 











<!-- - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 18.0 or above:
  - When installing Node.js, you are recommended to check all checkboxes related to dependencies.

## Generate a new site

Generate a new Docusaurus site using the **classic template**.

The classic template will automatically be added to your project after you run the command:

```bash
npm init docusaurus@latest my-website classic
```

You can type this command into Command Prompt, Powershell, Terminal, or any other integrated terminal of your code editor.

The command also installs all necessary dependencies you need to run Docusaurus.

## Start your site

Run the development server:

```bash
cd my-website
npm run start
```

The `cd` command changes the directory you're working with. In order to work with your newly created Docusaurus site, you'll need to navigate the terminal there.

The `npm run start` command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at http://localhost:3000/.

Open `docs/intro.md` (this page) and edit some lines: the site **reloads automatically** and displays your changes. -->
